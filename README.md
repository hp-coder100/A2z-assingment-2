## Task 0: Login Page

Create a login page where users can log in with their username and password. Include a "Forgot Password" section.

## Task 1: Landing Page

Create a landing page with a welcome message that addresses the user by name and the time of day. For example, "Good Morning, Rescuer! How are you doing today, Sam?" Design a navigation menu that allows users to create a new ticket.

## Task 2: New Ticket Page

Design a new ticket page with the following fields:

- Lead Source
- Name
- Contact Number
- Email Address
- Vehicle Make
- Vehicle Registration Number
- Breakdown Issue
- Location
- Service Fee
- Assistance Time
- Comments

Design a "Submit" button for submitting the form. Upon clicking the button, display a pop-up screen that says "New Task Created Successfully."

**Additional Notes:**

1. All fields except Service Fee are mandatory.
2. The Lead Source field should be a drop-down with options: Web, Chat, Call.
3. Validate the Email Address field to ensure it contains a valid email address.
4. Vehicle Registration Number should be in all caps and not allow spaces between characters.
5. Assistance Time should show the current time/calendar time for scheduling the ticket.

All pages should be designed to be responsive, allowing them to be viewed on desktop/laptop and mobile phones.

## Technologies Used -React JS

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
